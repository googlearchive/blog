_In this installment of the community highlights, blog posts from near and far; a new showcase; polymer snippets; and a custom
element to help you submit forms._

## Polymer features you may have missed

On the Divshot blog, Michael Bleigh wrote about some [Polymer Features You May Have Missed](https://divshot.com/blog/web-components/polymer-features-you-may-have-missed/), including attribute reflection, layout attributes, and some of the convenience methods built in to Polymer elements.


## Built with Polymer

Also from the good folks at Divshot, [builtwithpolymer.org](http://builtwithpolymer.org/) is a new showcase for apps 
and sites built with Polymer. It's also an [open-source project](https://github.com/divshot/built-with-polymer) written in Polymer. 
Check it out! If you have a site you'd like to show off, you can either send them a note 
or submit a pull request to the [Github repo](https://github.com/divshot/built-with-polymer).

## Polymer on IBM developerWorks

Sing Li has written an introduction to Polymer on IBM developerWorks, 
[Join the Web Components revolution with Polymer](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-polymer/), 
as part of an ongoing series of articles on web components.



## Polymer & Web components snippets for Sublime Text

If you use Sublime Text, you might want to try Rob Dodson's 
[Polymer and Web Components Snippets for Sublime](https://github.com/robdodson/PolymerSnippets). You 
can install them using the Package Control plugin or manually from the 
[Github repo](https://github.com/robdodson/PolymerSnippets).


## The `ajax-form` element

Recently several people have asked about how to submit form elements. Many custom input 
elements, including the Core and Paper input elements, don't work well with the native 
`<form>` element. Of course you can submit form data using an `XMLHttpRequest`, but 
that means writing your own boilerplate to package up the values and send the request.
 
Ray Nicholus' `ajax-form` element provides a simple way to submit forms. `ajax-form` works 
with traditional form elements, as well as any custom elements that have both a `name` 
attribute and a `value` -- including the Core and Paper input elements.
